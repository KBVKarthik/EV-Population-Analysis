    "To identify complex and unobvious correlations in the dataset for management research, we can explore relationships that go beyond simple descriptive statistics. Here are some ideas for deeper analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Electric Vehicle Adoption Trends**\n",
    "   - **Correlation between Model Year and Electric Range**: Investigate if newer models have significantly higher electric ranges and how this trend evolves over time.\n",
    "   - **State-wise EV Adoption**: Analyze the distribution of EVs across states and legislative districts to identify regions with higher adoption rates and potential reasons (e.g., incentives, infrastructure).\n",
    "   - **Make vs. Electric Range**: Compare manufacturers (e.g., Tesla, BMW) to see if certain brands consistently offer higher ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Economic Factors**\n",
    "   - **Base MSRP vs. Electric Range**: Explore if higher-priced EVs tend to have better electric ranges and whether this relationship is linear or non-linear.\n",
    "   - **Legislative District vs. Base MSRP**: Investigate if wealthier districts (proxied by MSRP) are more likely to adopt EVs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "   - **CAFV Eligibility vs. Electric Range**: Analyze if vehicles eligible for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) incentives have higher or lower ranges compared to non-eligible vehicles.\n",
    "   - **Legislative District vs. CAFV Eligibility**: Check if certain districts have a higher proportion of eligible vehicles, potentially indicating policy effectiveness.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
